### DeFi?
A collection of links relating to DeFi.
A high level discussion about pro and cons of centralised lending, de centralised lending and LPs can be found here: [Reddit on DeFi for beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/so1ns8/i_have_so_many_questions_about_defi_i_cant_find)

The true power of defi comes from being early to a platform, luring suckers in, and dumping native tokens on them. Its all about getting high APY paid in shitcoins and dumping it to HODLers in exchange for BTC, ETH, USDC, etc.

People will try to sugercoat this mantra in various ways but just keep what I said in the back of your mind.
