**[Reddit introduction on Lending & Borrowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mnzv1c/defi_explained_lending_borrowing/)**

## CEX lending
non de-central platforms offering a return for depositing crypto including stable coins. Often offering a 10+% return on stable coins.

**Key examples:**
:   hodlnaut
:   youhodl
:   swissborg finance
:   midas.investment
:   yield.app
:   haruinvest
:   vauld.com
:   wirex
:   coinloan.io
:   ledn.io
:   celsius
:   blockFi

**Key points:**
:   ... may require a deposit and/or interest payment in their native token
:   ... are centralised
:   ... if stablecoin is an ethereum token factor in transaction costs if no other alternative chain is available
