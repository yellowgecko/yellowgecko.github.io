## COSMOS chain
##### Stake ATOM
Stake ATOM in KEPL wallet. use a validator between 100 and 145. Withdraw CRO, SCRT, LUNA, UST to kelpr and change on OSMOSIS. **Note: neeed some ATOM for transaction fees**. staking ATOM, receive OSMO and JUNO on Osmosis (Atom DEX)

<br><br>

##### Route to COSMOS
1. btc > binance
2. exchange for ATOM
3. withdraw ATOM to keplr wallet

1. _tbc_ maybe RenBridge again? [IBC InterBlockchain](https://blog.cosmos.network/bitcoin-is-coming-to-cosmos-with-interbtc-16b1fc854728)

#### OSMOSIS
is a cross chain AMM build on COSMOS/ATOM. Uses Keplr wallet. Osmosis has IBC (Inter - Blockchain Communication) built-in from the start, allowing it to connect to the entire Cosmos chain ecosystem

##### OSMOSIS.ZONE examples
Here's the yields for pool #601 on osmosis for example:
>ðŸ§ª osmosis pool 601 50% CMDX / 50% OSMO
> liquidity: 3,815,257.87 CMDX 963,665.79 OSMO
> total liq.: 15,665,518.15 USD 24h vol.: 355,934.25 USD
> rewards: total osmo/day: 8,051.82 APR: 152.71 % APY: 359.01 %
> additional rewards: CMDX APR: 79.61 % APY: 121.49 %
> swap fee: 0.30 % swap fees 24h: 1,067.80 USD fee APY: 2.52 %
> LUNA/OSMO and LUNA UST pools 
Look at the pools on Osmo. Do some research if you need to. Luna/Osmo APR at 92.99% currently, Luna/UST at 70.85%

provide liquidity on NGM, STARS, CMDX, EEUR pools on Osmosis Dex.

stake Atom and Juno, follow new projects and get drops. We provide liquidity on JunoSwapDex

## Terra
Terra has Anchor, currently offering 20% APY for UST. See lÃ¶ping example using Mirror protocol with mSLVR. Revisit **wormhole** issue/ story.
LUNA-bLUNA stake farming on Terraswap

#### Loop UST on Terra with silver
On Terra you can use your UST in Anchor Earn for 20% APY and then use that deposit as collateral to borrow stocks on Mirror Protocol. There are various strategies, one of them would be:
1. Deposit $10K UST in Anchor (you get aUST)
2. Borrow mSLV with your aUST
3. Sell mSLV at Terraswap for UST
4. Repeat 4x and deposit to Anchor
5. You now have $20K UST earning 19,5% APY instead of $10K
6. Buy mSLV on dips to hedge

This strategy works when:
*   The price of mSLV stays flat or goes down
*   The price of mSLV doesn't increase more than the 19,5% you are earning extra per year   
The breakeven point after 1 year is obviously if the price of mSLV is 19,5% higher...


**comments on UST on Anchor:**

> There are lots of reasons to pick one project over another. With regards to Anchor - firstly it's not that easy to get money on Terra. 
> None of the major exchanges support it and you lose a lot of money in bridges. Secondly you may assess the risk of being 
> hacked or rugged to be much higher on Anchor. Thirdly maybe you've never heard of Anchor Protocol since it's nowhere near 
> as famous as AAVE. Fourthly maybe you're stuck on one chain or another for other reasons. A lot of other protocols put 
> their funds on AAVE and they may not have the technical ability to flip their funds across different chains.

## NEAR chain
#### REF, OIN
See [NEAR farming guide](https://blog.defiyield.app/the-ultimate-yield-farming-guide-for-near-protocol-ce27046d8218)

Checkout Ref finance for NEAR, pooling OIN-STNEAR

comments on REV/NEAR:     
> First I believe in NEAR as a Layer 1 and I prefer to diversify across a single ecosystem than multiple.

Stop "believing in" coins. Everything about a coin can be great, and something unforseeable can come along and cause the coin to fail. This is why even the best analysts often make incorrect predictions, and I doubt you're one of the best analysts. If NEAR fails, your entire plan is gonna fail. The best analysts know they're fallible and diversify, and so should you.

>    Ref will grow linearly with NEAR and automatically diversity across and entire L1.

REF will not grow linearly with NEAR. Look at these tokenomics. You're looking at 50% dilution over the next 4 years. And if NEAR grows, other DEXs will launch on NEAR, which will split the subeconomy.

And REF won't diversify across the entire L1. The REF coin staking is a bet on trading volume, not on price, and it's quite possible for coins in the ecosystem to go up in price without a lot of trading volume. If anything, a downward market causes more trading volume than an upward market: look at the graph on the right side of this page and you'll see more volume the last few days due to panic trading than in any previous weeks.

Make no mistake, you're not diversified. You're in two coins (NEAR and REF) staked in two pools that depend on transaction and trading volume on one chain.

I am not sure I'd even invest in this strategy at all, let alone put my entire crypto bags in it. It's not an insane strategy as part of a diversified portfolio, but I don't like those REF tokenomics. And it IS an insane strategy if you're closing your savings account and putting it all in this.
