### Borrow against collateral
The most common reasons usually center around depositing collateral in one coin, and borrowing in another coin. 
The two most common ways this can be profitable are [Reddit source](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/sq9t8i/unless_apy_is_positive_what_is_the_point_of/):
    1. Interest rate arbitrage. Let's say I'm holding ETH and the highest single-staking APR I can find on ETH is 8%. 
    However, I might be able to find stable coin yields around 30%. So I can deposit $1000 worth of 
    ETH to a borrowing platform which receives 5% APR, borrow $500 worth of USDC for 10% APR, and 
    farm that USDC for 30% APR.  
    The total APR I'm receiving on my ETH in this case is 5% + (500/1000)x(30% - 10%) = 15%, which is significantly 
    higher than the 8% I was able to find by single-staking. These numbers are an example: you'll have to 
    find your own interest rate arbitrage opportunities in the real world.
    2. Shorting. Let's say I'm holding ETH and I think LTC will go down. 
    I can deposit $1000 worth of ETH into a borrowing platform, borrow $500 worth of LTC, and then sell that LTC for USDC. 
    Now if the price of LTC falls by 50%, I can buy back the same amount of LTC for 250 USDC, 
    repay my loan, and pocket the other 250 USDC.
