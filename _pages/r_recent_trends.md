### Borrow against collateral
The most common reasons usually center around depositing collateral in one coin, and borrowing in another coin. 
The two most common ways this can be profitable are [Reddit source](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/sq9t8i/unless_apy_is_positive_what_is_the_point_of/):

1. **Interest rate arbitrage.**\\
Let's say I'm holding ETH and the highest single-staking APR I can find on ETH is 8%. 
However, I might be able to find stable coin yields around 30%. So I can deposit $1000 worth of 
ETH to a borrowing platform which receives 5% APR, borrow $500 worth of USDC for 10% APR, and 
farm that USDC for 30% APR.    
The total APR I'm receiving on my ETH in this case is 5% + (500/1000)x(30% - 10%) = 15%, which is significantly 
higher than the 8% I was able to find by single-staking. These numbers are an example: you'll have to 
find your own interest rate arbitrage opportunities in the real world.
2. **Shorting.**\\
Let's say I'm holding ETH and I think LTC will go down. 
I can deposit $1000 worth of ETH into a borrowing platform, borrow $500 worth of LTC, and then sell that LTC for USDC. 
Now if the price of LTC falls by 50%, I can buy back the same amount of LTC for 250 USDC, 
repay my loan, and pocket the other 250 USDC.

### Loop UST on Terra with silver
On Terra you can use your UST in Anchor Earn for 20% APY and then use that deposit as collateral to borrow stocks on Mirror Protocol. There are various strategies, one of them would be:
1. Deposit $10K UST in Anchor (you get aUST)
2. Borrow mSLV with your aUST
3. Sell mSLV at Terraswap for UST
4. Repeat 4x and deposit to Anchor
5. You now have $20K UST earning 19,5% APY instead of $10K
6. Buy mSLV on dips to hedge

This strategy works when:
*   The price of mSLV stays flat or goes down
*   The price of mSLV doesn't increase more than the 19,5% you are earning extra per year   
The breakeven point after 1 year is obviously if the price of mSLV is 19,5% higher...

**comments on UST on Anchor:**

There are lots of reasons to pick one project over another. With regards to Anchor - firstly it's not that easy to get money on Terra. 
None of the major exchanges support it and you lose a lot of money in bridges. Secondly you may assess the risk of being 
hacked or rugged to be much higher on Anchor. Thirdly maybe you've never heard of Anchor Protocol since it's nowhere near 
as famous as AAVE. Fourthly maybe you're stuck on one chain or another for other reasons. A lot of other protocols put 
their funds on AAVE and they may not have the technical ability to flip their funds across different chains.
